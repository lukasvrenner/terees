A collection of tree-like data structures

## Current Supported Data Structures
- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree

### Planned Additions
- AVL Tree
- B-Tree

### Note:
current implemnations for all structures do *not* support emptiness.\
such a feature would be very convenient, but, as of now, a feasable solution
is out of sight.
